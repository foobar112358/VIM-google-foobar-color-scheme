# google-foobar-color-scheme
This is a recently started, ongoing project.

I have uploaded a picture of the terminal to sample the colors 
NOTE: The "code" picture does not make any sense! I have tried to display all colors in one screenshot.
Use this to sample colors for the color scheme

# Primary Goal:
To create a color scheme for VIM text editor 

Other Goal:
Use above implementation to make color schemes for other popular text editors
